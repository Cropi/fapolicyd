Kernel
======
Add ability to specify auxiliary information about which rule number triggers

Userspace
=========
* Add --check-status cli to send a signal to the daemon to output metrics to /var/run/ cli then reads and writes to console
* On startup, pid file and check if /proc maps to fapolicyd terminate if so
* Close issue 182 since we keep the pid file
* Do trust db size check on all updates
* add db_max_size = auto
* Allow rules to express paths using globbing (fnmatch)

Consider adding rule testing to cli (uid, pgm, file)
Support other packaging manifests
